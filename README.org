* File Explorer is is an alternative to ls, written in c++
I did this mostly for fun, practice and something to keep myself occupied with. It is very lacking and should not be used as a serious alternative to ls.

** Installation

1) Clone the repository: via https =git clone https://github.com/Eurydice86/file_explorer.git= or ssh =git clone git@github.com:Eurydice86/file_explorer.git=
2) Add the executable to your system PATH (for instance, you can copy it to =/usr/local/bin/=: =sudo cp file_explorer/fexp /usr/local/bin/=)
