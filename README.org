* File Explorer is is an alternative to ls, written in c++
I did this mostly for fun, practice and something to keep myself occupied with. It is very lacking and should not be used as a serious alternative to ls.

** Installation

1) Clone the repository: via https =git clone https://github.com/Eurydice86/file_explorer.git= or ssh =git clone git@github.com:Eurydice86/file_explorer.git=
2) Add the executable to your system PATH (for instance, you can copy it to =/usr/local/bin/=: =sudo cp fexp /usr/local/bin/=)

** Features
- Directory names are shown in a different colour.
- Files and directories also show an icon next to them.

** Known issues
- This does not (yet) work with directory names like "~" or "/".
- The flags are not doing anything yet, they are simply printed out.

** To do
- Fix bug mentioned in the first known issue.
- Implement flags functionality.
